The exercise guide will be done by the Partner BTP trial accounts. To get started, follow https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html Follow the \"Prerequisite\" section to install the necessary tools. Candidates should have preliminary knowledge on NodeJS, SAPUI5 and Business Technology Platform. Prerequisite \u00b6 node ( Node.js version 12.x or 14.x is recommended) SAP Fiori Tools https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/generator-fiori docker (for example, Docker Desktop for macOS or Windows) A source code editor ( Visual Studio Code is recommended) bash or zsh shell to run the command snippets on MacOS or Linux, or Git Bash for Windows, MinGW, or Cygwin ) kubectl ( Kubernetes Command Line tool ), see this tutorial how to install it cf ( Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI) ) mta ( Multitarget application interface ) git ( Git Downloads ) Download postman tool Step 1 - Configure your Trial Account \u00b6 Go to SAP BTP Cockpit . Choose Go To Your Trial Account . If you don't have a user, you need to register for a free. Wait for the completion of the on-boarding. You should land on the Subaccounts page of your Global Account on trial. Choose trial . From the Navigation area , choose Security Trust Configuration . Select the default IdP by clicking on the name attribute. The name might be SAP ID Service or Default Identity provider . Enter the e-mail of the user to whom you want to give permissions. Click Show Assignments . Click Assign Role Collection . From the Assign Role Collection dropdown list, select the relevant role collection: Select Business_Application_Studio_Developer to assign a role collection to a developer. Select Business_Application_Studio_Administrator to assign a role collection to an administrator. Select Business_Application_Studio_Extension_Deployer to assign a role collection to an extension developer. Step 2 - Enable Kyma in Trial Account \u00b6 You need an SAP BTP Subaccount with consumption-based model (that is, Cloud Credits). For this tutorial you have two options: Option 1: Create Your Own SAP BTP Trial Account \u00b6 Go to SAP BTP Cockpit . Choose Go To Your Trial Account . You should land on the Subaccounts page of your Global Account on trial. Choose trial . Go to Kyma Environment . Choose Enable Kyma . Provide a Cluster Name . Choose Create . This takes a while. You can start the tutorial in the meantime. Option 2: Use Your Existing SAP BTP Subaccount \u00b6 If you already have an older trial account, then you might not see the Enable Kyma button. In that case: Go to Entitlements . Choose Configure Entitlements . Choose Add Service Plans . Search for and select Kyma runtime . Check the trial (Environment) checkbox. Choose Add 1 Service Plan . Choose Enable Kyma . Provide a Cluster Name . Choose Create . This takes a while. You can start the tutorial in the meantime. Step 3 - Assign Kyma Roles to User \u00b6 SAP BTP\u2019s XSUAA is used to access the Kyma runtime. Please follow the steps to assign Roles in the Kyma Environment . Step 4 - Getting started with Business Application Studio \u00b6 SAP Business Application Studio is a development environment available on SAP Business Technology Platform. To get started, please follow the link: https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html Step 5 - Install SAP Plant Connectivity \u00b6 With SAP Plant Connectivity (PCo), SAP provides a software component that enables the exchange of data between an SAP system and the industry-specific standard data sources of different manufacturers, for example, process control systems, plant Historian systems, and SPC systems. Follow this link for more details SAP Plant Connectivity Step 6 - Install SAP Cloud Connector \u00b6 Configure a cloud connector that acts as a reverse invoke proxy between an on-premises network and SAP Business Technology Platform. The cloud connector comes standard as part of the SAP Cloud Integration service and serves as a link between SAP Business Technology Platform and on-premise systems such as SAP S/4HANA. Follow this link for more details Setting Up the Cloud Connector Step 7 - Configure Machine Model in DMC \u00b6 SAP Plant Connectivity is the connectivity layer between SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud and the shop floor. As SAP Plant Connectivity is installed on the customer's premises, a cloud connector is required for the communication from SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud to SAP Plant Connectivity. In addition, the communication needs to be secured by valid certificates. Follow this link for more details Integrate with SAP Plant Connectivity Step 8 - Integration with SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA (Optional) \u00b6 SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud for execution uses SAP Cloud Integration to communicate with external SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA systems. You can connect various ERP systems, for example one system per plant or country. The global SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud for execution system is used across all plants. Follow this link for more details Integration with SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA Step 9 - Load DMC Demo Data to be done by SAP team \u00b6 We will be loading the basic data that will be needed for bootcamp excercise and for this we need create key Digital manufacturing instance and you can follow this link to get or create the key as needed. Step 10 - Postman collection for DMC \u00b6 This is the collection from SAP API Hub , you can also download the below collection to work with postman. Download postman collection Download postman environment Import collection in Postman Import environment in Postman Your postman is ready to use BTP Services for DMC Extensions \u00b6 SAP Business Application Studio SAP Business Application Studio is a development environment available on SAP Business Technology Platform. Follow this link for more details https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/business-application-studio?region=all Kyma Runtime SAP BTP, Kyma runtime is a fully managed Kubernetes runtime based on the open-source project \"Kyma\". This cloud-native solution allows the developers to extend SAP solutions with serverless Functions and combine them with containerized microservices. The offered functionality ensures smooth consumption of SAP and non-SAP applications, running workloads in a highly scalable environment, and building event- and API-based extensions. Follow this link for more details https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3252/3281/ Cloud Foundary Runtime The SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime lets you develop polyglot cloud-native applications and run them on the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment. Follow this link for more details https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-foundry-runtime?region=all HTML5 Application Repository The HTML5 Application Repository service for SAP BTP enables central storage of HTML5 applications on SAP BTP. The service allows application developers to manage the lifecycle of their HTML5 applications. In runtime, the service enables the consuming application, typically the application router, to access HTML5 application static content in a secure and efficient manner. Follow this link for more details https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/html5-application-repository-service?region=all Destination Service The Destination service lets you retrieve the backend destination details you need to configure applications in the Cloud Foundry environment. Follow this link for more details https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/destination?service_plan=lite&region=all SAP Integration Suite (CPI) SAP Integration Suite connects and contextualizes processes and data while enabling new content-rich applications to be assembled faster with less dependence on IT. Pre-built integration packs along with existing investments can be composed to deliver new outcomes with less involvement by integration experts.
